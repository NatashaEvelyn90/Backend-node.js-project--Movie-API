Steps of creating a website from pulling API information:
Website we will be using: https://sampleapis.com/ We will be creating from the MOVIE category!

First step, make sure you create a .gitignore page. Make sure within that .gitignore page you have the following:
    - Node_modules/
    - *-lock.json
These will lock the pages that people do not need to touch if you have to hand it off to someone else

Next, you would need to  make sure you open your terminal (gitbash or VScode) and type in:
    - npm init -y
Typing that code in the terminal will install basically express? Node.js? I can't remember but it is installing what you would need to be able to create your webpage.
After doing so, make sure you run the packages you need to install. In this one, we will be installing AXIOS, EXPRESS and EJS. There is a fourth one but we will not be installing them this time. Check your Microsoft OneNote for the list of packages you can install for future use.

To install the packages, you would type:
npm install axios
npm i ejs
npm i express
* I wrote it two ways and both ways would work for installation. Choose whichever works best for you!

Next, make sure you add a file called app.js or server.js. Whichever you perfer to use as that would be your main file where you will list your website PORT and such. (In this one, I will be using app.js!)

After installing the packages, it is best to go into your package.json file that was created the moment you ran the npm init -y command. Within that file, there are a few things that you want to check are correct and a few things you will have to add. 
    -First, in the first section, there should be 4 categories: "Name, version, description and main". The section you want to update is the main. It might have something else added in there. make sure you change it to the file you created. (app.js or server.js)
    -Second, in the SCRIPTS section, make sure you add a commma after the 1 in the "test". Underneath "test" you will add:
        "start": "node server.js",
        "dev": "nodemon server.js"
    -Continue down and in the third secton, you will have keywords, author, license, type, bugs and url. (if you don't have some of them listed, that is okay as well because I created a folder via gitHub first and then it created everything else.) In the AUTHOR section, go ahead and add your name within the quotes. You can use your actual name or an author name or so forth. You can also leave it blank. 
    -Lastly, there is extra stuff at the bottom that states homepage, dependencies, and then under dependencies, it should list everything that is installed. SO for this project, you should have axios, ejs and express already installed.

LETS BUILD THE WEBSITE!!!

APP.JS page
First, go to your app.js/server.js and type as follows: 
    -const express = require('express')
    -const app = express()
For this, you are basically stating that you are needing to use the program "EXPRESS" to be able to run/start your website. Google and ChatGPT states that youa re importing the Express library into your Node.js application.     

    -const router = require('./routes/router')
    -const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4200
Const router is telling you to import the router.js document basically.
Const PORT bascially is you creating a website PORT number. Usually there are numbers to websites and we are using 4200 as an example. Some actual companies have particular numbers that they use. ChatGPT states that cloud environments like Heroku, Render and AWS automatically set the PORT for you. 

    -app.use('/', router) 
    -app.set('view engine', 'ejs')

    -app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server is listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`))

If you are using a server.js file, make sure where I have listed the word "app" you put the word "server" instead. 

**  **  **

CREATE ROUTES folder and add ROUTER.JS file
In the router.js file that you have created, make sure you add these in the file. 

const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()
const axios = require('axios')
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4200


//! This is your main homepage right here 
//? http://localhost:4200
router.get('/', (req, res)=> {
    res.render('pages/home', {
                //* the title is going to show in your header.ejs + home.ejs.  You are using EJS for this! Name is showing in home.ejs
                title: "Movies Galore!",
                name: "Crazpicc's movie gallery",
            })
})

router.use('/', require('./api/movieRoutes'))

//! 404 ERROR page
router.use((req, res, next)=> {
    res.status(404)
    .render('pages/error404', {
        title: '404',
        name: 'THAT PAGE DOES NOT EXIST'
    })
})

module.exports = router

**  **  **
CREATE an API folder in ROUTES folder and CREATE MOVIEROUTES.JS fILE
//! Everything you will be doing will mainly be in this page.
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()
const axios = require('axios')
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4200

//! ANIMATION MOVIES 
//? http://localhost:4200/animation
router.get('/animation', (req, res)=> {
    const url = 'https://api.sampleapis.com/movies/animation'

    axios.get(url)
        .then(resp => {
            res.render('pages/allMovies', {
                title: 'Animation Movies',
                name: 'Animation Movies',
                data: resp.data
            })
        })
})





**If you are looking back at your notes and you look at the jokesRoutes.js and the router.js and you see the http://localhost:3001/jokes and then see http://localhost:3001, they are both basically a homepage. HOWEVER, the one that is the /jokes shows ALL the jokes vs the 3001 only shows the homepage hub (with a joke on the homepage). But honestly, you really don't need the /jokes one and just keep your homepage and continue on making all the other pages.
